# Timer & Booking

Roots offers several ways to log time.

## Timer

Start a timer to track work in real-time:

1. Click the **Timer** button in the toolbar
2. Select a project and task (from Moco)
3. Optionally add a description
4. Click **Start**

While running, the timer shows elapsed time in the toolbar and as a dock badge on macOS. You can **pause** and **resume** the timer at any time.

When you stop the timer, you can either:

- **Book directly** — creates a Moco time entry immediately
- **Save as draft** — saves the entry for later booking

## Drafts

Drafts are unsaved time entries that persist across sessions. They're useful when you stop a timer but aren't ready to book the time yet.

- Open the **Drafts drawer** from the toolbar to see all saved drafts
- Each draft shows the date, hours, project/task and description
- Click a draft to **book it to Moco** or **delete** it
- **Delete all** drafts at once with the button at the bottom

Drafts shorter than 1 minute are automatically discarded.

## Quick Booking

Create a time entry without the timer:

1. Right-click in the Moco column or use the **+** button
2. Select project, task and enter hours
3. Add an optional description
4. Click **Save**

## Book from Outlook

Convert a calendar event into a Moco entry:

1. Hover over an Outlook event card
2. Click the **+** icon that appears
3. Select the target project and task
4. The duration and description are pre-filled from the event
5. Click **Book**

## Favorites

Pin project/task pairs for frequent use:

- **Add a favorite** from any Moco entry's context menu
- **Use a favorite** by clicking it in the sidebar to start a quick booking
- **Reorder** by dragging favorites in the sidebar
- **Edit or remove** via the favorite's context menu
