# Timer & Booking

Roots offers several ways to log time.

## Timer

Start a timer to track work in real-time:

1. Click the **Timer** button in the toolbar
2. Select a project and task (from Moco)
3. Optionally add a description
4. Click **Start**

While running, the timer shows elapsed time in the toolbar. When you stop it, Roots creates a Moco time entry with the recorded duration.

## Quick Booking

Create a time entry without the timer:

1. Right-click in the Moco column or use the **+** button
2. Select project, task and enter hours
3. Add an optional description
4. Click **Save**

## Book from Outlook

Convert a calendar event into a Moco entry:

1. Hover over an Outlook event card
2. Click the **+** icon that appears
3. Select the target project and task
4. The duration and description are pre-filled from the event
5. Click **Book**

## Favorites

Pin project/task pairs for frequent use:

- **Add a favorite** from any Moco entry's context menu
- **Use a favorite** by clicking it in the sidebar to start a quick booking
- **Reorder** by dragging favorites in the sidebar
- **Edit or remove** via the favorite's context menu
